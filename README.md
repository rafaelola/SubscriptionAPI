Technical Test
==============

Thanks for showing interest in working with PM Connect! Below is a technical test we use to gauge a candidate's technical level. It should take no longer than 7 days, at which point we ask you to submit what you have. We want to see your flair and individuality so donâ€™t be afraid to add things not in the spec, you can use any language or tech to achieve this.

## Subscription API

PMSubService is a subscription service that provides a company with its subscription needs, your task is to produce an API to handle subscribing, unsubscribing, and listing phone identifiers (a unique identifier for a phone, a phone number for example) for a given product identifier.

You will need to produce endpoints for the following functionality:

### Parameters:

- **msisdn**: A phone number, this may be provided in national format (e.g. 07700900797) or international format (e.g. +447700900797)
- **product_id**: A string with a maximum length of 255 characters to identify the product.


### Subscribe a phone
- Accepts **msisdn** and **product_id** in the request query string.

### Unsubscribe a phone
- Accepts **msisdn** and **product_id** in the request query string.

### Find subscription
- Accepts a **msisdn** and returns the subscriptions related to it.

Anything not mentioned in the specification above is up to you. You may implement these endpoints how you see fit and should provide us with documentation on how to interact with them.

## Additional Requirements

The below are additional requirements for the API. Please implement as many of these as you wish, in any order. We do not expect you to implement them all.

In no specific order:

- All endpoints to return valid JSON.
- Returned subscriptions should include the subscribed and unsubscribed date.
- The product_id parameter on the unsubscribe endpoint should be optional.
- When only a msisdn is provided, it should unsubscribe from all products.
- All parameters may be provided in the request as a query string, via json, or via x-www-form-urlencoded.
- Implement CORS to enable requests to be made from JavaScript applications on different domains.
- Support multiple returned data types
- As well as accepting parameters in the query string, via json, or via x-www-form-urlencoded, also support parameters passed in by all of the supported returned data types.
- Allow changing of returned data type.
- Allow options requests to see supported data types for returned data and accepted data.
- Anything else you consider to be beneficial




Technical Solution
==============

### Database & Migration:

- **CustomerPhones table**: 
     - Unique **phone_no** column, to ensure the only unique value insertion.
     - Soft delete **deleted_at** column, this flag can aid in ensuring GDPR rules are adhered to (Since we are dealing with phone numbers).


- **Products table**: 
     - **product_by_user_id** column, to help identify who added the products.

- **Subscriptions table**: 
     - **subscribe_date** column, to help identify what dateTime the user susbscribed.
     - **unsubscribe_date** column, to help identify what dateTime the user unsusbscribed.
   - Soft delete **deleted_at** column, this flag can aid in ensuring GDPR rules are adhered to (Since we are dealing with subscription via phone number).
- **msisdn** column, indexed to help aid in searching(partitions)

### Validation :
- **CreateProductPosts**:
 - **validation rules**, name is required, type string & product is nullable and numeric.

- **CreatePhonePosts(super-class)** && **UpdatePhonePosts**(child):
 - **validation rules**, phone is required, type string & regex for valid phone numbers.


### Controllers :
- **API\PhoneController** - CRUD functions
- **API\ProductController**  - CRUD functions
- **API\SubscriptionController** - subscribe, unsubscribe and search
- **API\ApiPhoneValidator** - using Libphone number library to validated phone numbers before DB insertion. ref: https://libphonenumber-for-php.readthedocs.io/en/latest/PhoneNumberUtil/#example-numbers

### ResponseMacro :
Aids custom response message, with titles, status and message
- **response()->json('success')** - CRUD functions
- **response()->json('error')**  - CRUD functions


### Improvements:
- Before subscription a quick check if subscription for a given product using the phone number already exist.(Another solution is use **msisdn** as a foreign key (relationship between tables)).
- Can use lib phone library to validate phone numbers
- Use Twilio library for two-fa registration https://www.twilio.com/authy
- Middleware for GDRP (In scenario, where customer phone numbers are to be deleted, a pop up where the user have to acknlowledge GDRP rules, before deletion)
- Move to api routes; using laravel Passport (token-based authentication)
- Testing (Unfortunately due deadline was unable to write test cases)
- SOLID Principle & Factory Pattern
- Sanitization of posted data
